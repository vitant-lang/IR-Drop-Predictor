This project implements an enhanced UNet architecture with attention mechanisms and two optimization modules (EdgeAwareBlock for Chiplet edge enhancement and SmoothingBlock for Interposer continuity) to predict IR Drop from five input parameters: current distribution (current.csv), chiplet effective distance (chiplet_eff_dist.csv), chiplet PDN density (chiplet_pdn_density.csv), interposer effective distance (interposer_eff_dist.csv), and interposer density (interposer_density.csv). The system generates voltage drop heatmaps (chiplet_ir_drop.png and interposer_ir_drop.png), with all predictions and analysis charts automatically saved in ./Output/pred_results_checkpoint/. For GPU-accelerated execution, install dependencies via pip install -r requirements.txt (ensure Torch with CUDA support) and run the test script.
