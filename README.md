This project employs an enhanced UNet neural network architecture that takes five input parameters (current distribution current.csv, chiplet effective distance chiplet_eff_dist.csv, chiplet PDN density chiplet_pdn_density.csv, interposer effective distance interposer_eff_dist.csv, and interposer density interposer_density.csv) to predict IR Drop for both Chiplet and Interposer structures. The model integrates attention mechanisms along with two specialized optimization modules - the EdgeAwareBlock for Chiplet edge enhancement and the SmoothingBlock for Interposer continuity optimization. The system outputs voltage drop heatmaps (chiplet_ir_drop.png and interposer_ir_drop.png), with all prediction results and comparative analysis charts automatically saved in the ./Output/pred_results_checkpoint/ directory. Essentially, it processes 5 input parameters to generate 2 output predictions.
